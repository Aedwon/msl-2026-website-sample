# Role Difficulty Evaluation Prompt

**Context:**
I am managing a large student-led organization called **Moonton Student Leaders (MSL) Philippines**, which is the official student body powered by Moonton Games (creators of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang). We bridge the gap between academic life and esports.

**Organization Structure:**
The organization is divided into four specialized departments, each with distinct roles and responsibilities. I need a framework to evaluate and rank the "difficulty" or "weight" of these roles relative to each other to ensure fair compensation ("Diamond Salary") and recognition.

Here are the departments and their key roles:

### 1. Campus Department (Operations & Community)

**The Request:**

Based on the context above, please develop a **comprehensive framework to evaluate and rank the difficulty/complexity of these roles**.

**Please provide:**
1.  **Evaluation Criteria:** Define weighted factors to measure role difficulty (e.g., Technical Skill, Decision-Making Impact, Stress/Pressure, Time Commitment, Leadership Scope). Explain *why* each factor matters for this specific esports/student org context.
2.  **Scoring System:** A method to quantify these factors (e.g., a 1-10 scale for each criterion).
3.  **Tiered Ranking:** Based on your proposed framework, categorize the roles listed above into rigid "Tiers" (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4, Tier 5, Tier 6, Tier 7, etc).
    *   *Self-Correction:* If you feel a "Head of Finance" (handling money) is harder than a "Community Head" (handling one school), reflect that in the tiers.
    *   *Nuance:* distinguish between "Live" roles (high stress, short burst) vs. "Administrative" roles (lower stress, constant volume).
4.  **Justification:** Briefly explain the reasoning for the highest and lowest ranked roles.

**Goal:** This framework will be used to determine the monthly "Salary" (in-game currency) for these volunteers, so fairness and perceived effort are critical.
